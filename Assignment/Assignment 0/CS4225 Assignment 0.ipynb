We are using Hadoop Streaming, a variant of Hadoop which is easier to work with for our purposes as it allows the mapper and reducer to be any executable (and thus can be written in languages other than Java). Assignment 0 is a simple word count program, which just counts the number of occurrences of each word in a text document. You do not have to code anything for this assignment, but it is still important to go over this to familiarize with the Hadoop Streaming framework.\n","\n","In Hadoop Streaming, the mappers and reducers communicate via **lines of text**, rather than key-value pairs.
